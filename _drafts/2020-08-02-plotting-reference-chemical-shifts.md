## What are chemical shifts?

The **Chemical Shift** is one of the basic magnitudes in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR). The Chemical Shift is a dimensionless magnitude derived the frequency at
which some atomic nucleus precesses under a magnetic field. In plain words, it's a number that identifies an atom in a protein.
