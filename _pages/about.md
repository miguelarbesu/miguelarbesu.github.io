## Bio

My name is Miguel and I am a chemist by training, then evolved to a structural biologist by passion, with a strong interest in data science nowadays.

I studied a BSc [^1] in Chemistry at the University of Oviedo in my home region of Asturias, in northern Spain. I had always been interested in the biological aspect of Chemistry, and my initial idea was to switch to Biochemistry for a specialization. Finally, I decided to stay and focus on Organic Chemistry, but large molecules and supramolecular chemistry kept catching my attention.

I first got in touch with structural biology during an Erasmus stay at the University of Florence (Italy). I had the opportunity to spend some months at the Center of Magnetic Resonance (*CERM*), where I learned the basics of protein expression and purification and **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)**. I also learned about **Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)** for the first time, which quickly became my main area of interest. As a chemist stepping into molecular biology, these proteins defied my structure-centric mental schemes about cellular functions and sparked my curiosity.

Not less important, I met my now wife Sara during that Erasmus stay. She had transferred from Spain to Florence to work after enjoying a training period there funded by the Leonardo program. So, I like to think that our relationship is a total success for the European exchange initiatives and I strongly support such policies.

At the end of my time in Florence I met who would later be my PhD supervisor at the University of Barcelona, [Prof. Miquel Pons](http://bionmr.ub.edu/index.php). So, I then moved to Barcelona and obtained my MSc and PhD studying the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of human proto-oncogene c-Src.

The project aimed to the structural and functional characterization of a disordered stretch with no stable secondary structure, and also low sequence conservation among homologues. I was lucky to have a challenging project and an inspiring mentor, and our work allowed us in the end to describe a general framework for the disordered N-termini of the Src Family Kinases.

 During my time at the Pons lab I developed as a scientist in the broadest sense, beyond the acquisition of technical skills and specific knowledge. Miquel's dual brain (the chemist's and the biologist's) and curiosity made me

 learn a variety of biophysical methods, although NMR would remain the workhorse.

## Engagement with the scientific community

Since my arrival to FMP-Berlin in spring 2018,  ...
FMP+MDC PostDoc Association & PostDoc Day organizing committee.

## Karate

I practice Karate since I was 10 years old. I started practicing Shotokan style in my hometown, but then switched to Uechi Ryu karate after my Sensei Ángel Arenas. Under the supervision of Hanshi Kyohide Shinjo, head of Uechi Ryu Kenyukai in Okinawa, I currently hold a **3rd dan black belt**.

I am also a member of the [International Organization of Sport and Traditional Karate (IOSTK)](http://www.iostk.com/) and I was an instructor for 2 years during my time in Barcelona, teaching Uechi Ryu.

While in Barcelona, I also practiced Shito Ryu karate under Sensei Carlos Fernández for 5 years.

Now in Berlin, I train with the Uechi Ryu Okikukai group led by sensei Holger Massek, who kindly accepted me as a Kenyukai member.
