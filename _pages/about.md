## Bio

I am Miguel, a chemist by training and a structural biologist by passion.

I studied a B.Sc.[^1] in Chemistry at the University of Oviedo in my home region of Asturias, in the northern coast of Spain. I had always been interested in the biological aspect of the Chemistry, and my initial idea was to switch to Biochemistry, back then a 2-year specialization degree. Finally, I decided to stay and focus in Organic Chemistry, but large molecules and supramolecular chemistry kept catching my attention.

I got in touch with structural biology during an Erasmus stay at the University of Florence (Italy). I had the opportunity to spend a few months at the Center of Magnetic Resonance (*CERM*), where I learned the basics from protein expression and purification to **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)**. I also heard about **Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)** for the first time, which became my main area of interest.

During my stay in Florence, I met who would later be my PhD supervisor at the University of Barcelona, [Prof. Miquel Pons](http://bionmr.ub.edu/index.php). He offered me the opportunity to do a Master there and then a PhD. 

[^1]: The former 5-year plan (*Licenciatura*) is now equivalent to a B.Sc. + M.Sc.

## Other activities

I practice Karate since I was 10 years old. I started practicing Shotokan style in my hometown, but then switched to Uechi Ryu karate after my Sensei Ángel Arenas. Under the supervision of Hanshi Kyohide Shinjo, head of Uechi Ryu Kenyukai in Okinawa, I currently hold a **3rd dan black belt**.

I am also a member of the [International Organization of Sport and Traditional Karate (IOSTK)](http://www.iostk.com/) and was an instructor for 2 years during my PhD in Barcelona teaching Uechi Ryu.

While in Barcelona, I also practiced Shito Ryu karate under Sensei Carlos Fernández for 5 years.

Now in Berlin, I train with the Uechi Ryu Okikukai group led by sensei Holger Massek, who kindly accepted me as a Kenyukai member.
