## Bio

I am Miguel, a chemist by training and a structural biologist by passion. 

I studied a B.Sc.<sup>1<\sup> in Chemistry at the University of Oviedo in my home region of Asturias, in the northern coast of Spain. I had always been interested in the more biological aspect of the Chemistry, and my initial idea was to switch to Biochemistry, which was back then a 2 year specialization degree. Finally, I decided to stay and focus in Organic Chemistry, but large molecules and supramolecular chemistry kept catching my attention.

I got in touch with structural biology during an Erasmus stay at the University of Florence (Italy). I had the opportunity to spend a few months at the Center of Magnetic Resonance (*CERM*), where I learned the basics from protein expression and purification to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance **(NMR)** in solution. I also learned from Prof. Isabella Felli about Intrinsically Disordered Proteins **(IDPs)**, which became my main area of interest. 

During my stay, the CERM was responsible of organizing the first joint EUROMAR ISMAR conference, where I met who would later be my PhD supervisor at the University of Barcelona, [Prof. Miquel Pons](http://bionmr.ub.edu/index.php). He offered me the opportunity to work with the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of the human kinase c-Src. 

<sup>1<\sup>: The former five year plan (*Licenciatura*) actually corresponds to a B.Sc. + M.Sc., but that was legally recognized a couple of years after I obtained my M.Sc. separately.
