## Bio

I am Miguel, a chemist by training and a structural biologist by passion.

I studied a B.Sc.[^1] in Chemistry at the University of Oviedo in my home region of Asturias, in the northern coast of Spain. I had always been interested in the biological aspect of the Chemistry, and my initial idea was to switch to Biochemistry, back then a 2-year specialization degree. Finally, I decided to stay and focus in Organic Chemistry, but large molecules and supramolecular chemistry kept catching my attention.

I got in touch with structural biology during an Erasmus stay at the University of Florence (Italy). I had the opportunity to spend a few months at the Center of Magnetic Resonance (*CERM*), where I learned the basics from protein expression and purification to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance **(NMR)**. From Prof. Isabella Felli, I learned about Intrinsically Disordered Proteins **(IDPs)**, which became my main area of interest.

During my stay in Florence, the CERM was responsible of organizing the first joint EUROMAR-ISMAR conference, where I met who would later be my PhD supervisor at the University of Barcelona, [Prof. Miquel Pons](http://bionmr.ub.edu/index.php). He offered me the opportunity to work with the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of the human kinase c-Src.

[^1]: The former 5-year plan (*Licenciatura*) actually corresponds to a B.Sc. + M.Sc., but that was legally recognized a couple of years after I obtained my M.Sc. separately.
